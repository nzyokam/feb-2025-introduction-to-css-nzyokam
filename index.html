        This is a sample paragraph: <br />
        <i>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</i> can generate a positive reputation
        for a company leading to possibly more sales and growth. According to
        Jones et al (2019), a corporation that invests in the environmental and
        ethical approaches of CSR will demonstrate to the public and the media
        that they are a responsible company. Watson (2018) provides evidence
        that this improves consumer sales as customers tend to support ethical
        green business practice thus improving profitability and encouraging
        growth. For example, a yoghurt company called Yeo Valley has been
        investing in making its products organic, creating fully recyclable
        packaging and reducing its CO2 output. As a result, profits have doubled
        within the last two years providing the company with a range of
        opportunities to expand (Peterson, 2019). Overall, the evidence seems to
        suggest that investing in CSR can improve brand image and productivity.
